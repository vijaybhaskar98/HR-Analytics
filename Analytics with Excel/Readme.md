# Analytics Solution for Harly-Dasan Pvt ltd

## Problem Statement
Harly Dasan, a well-established company in the service sector, provides various services, including Human Resources. Initially, the company focused on data storage services, as analytics was not a requirement. Over time, the company expanded into various segments, creating a gap in tracking analytics effectively.

Most of the company's data resides in Excel, scattered across multiple ERP tools and systems. Due to security barriers, advanced analytical tools like Power BI could not be implemented effectively. After conducting extensive research and analyzing the target audience, I decided to build an analytics solution using Excel. Despite its limitations, this approach proved effective for the organization's needs.
